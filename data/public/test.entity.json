{"question": "question: What organizations are involved in the study? context: Funding: The study is sponsored by GSK Biologicals SA, the vaccine developer and manufacturer, and funded by both GSK Biologicals SA and the PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative (MVI). The study was designed by the Clinical Trials Partnership Committee (CTPC), consisting of representatives of all research sites, study sponsor and study funders (as detailed in Leach et al. 2011 [18]). All authors were involved in data collection. All data were analyzed following a pre-defined analysis plan. The CTPC had full access to the study data, made the decision to publish the manuscript in its current form, and prepared the manuscript. The findings and conclusions in this article are those of the authors. They do not necessarily represent the views of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Competing interests: The trial was sponsored by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA (GSK), the vaccine developer and manufacturer, and funded by both GSK Biologicals SA and the PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative (MVI). All centers declare receiving a grant from MVI for running the trial. Author travel and accommodation related to this trial were financed by MVI. GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA received a grant from MVI to run the trial. MVI received a grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to run this trial and to compensate MVI authors for trial-related travel. Additional conflicts of interest are as follows: JJA and PAl declare that their institutions received grant from the Catalan government and from the International Agency for Development and Cooperation.

PB, SD, BG, CK, PL, CMai, GMwam, BO, and LO declare that their institution has received grants from MVI for other malaria studies. KM declares that his institution received a grant from the Wellcome Trust and that he received support from USAID and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to participate in a scientific advisory group on malaria. MML declares that she received non-financial support from the WHO and the Biom\u00e9rieux Foundation. PN declares that she received financial support from GSK to present the results of the study at ASTMH congress in 2012. LO declares that he received support from GSK to carry out clinical and epidemiological studies. JSa has received (for the Center) some GlaxoSmithKline group of companies' consultancy fees for other studies. MTa is a board member of the Optimus Foundation, and his institution is reimbursed for his activities on the scientific advisory board of the Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases. He also has received for his institution other grants from MVI and from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and travel reimbursements from MVI and Sanaria corp.

Role of the Sponsor: The sponsor, Pfizer, participated in discussions regarding study design and protocol development and provided logistical support during the trial. Monitoring of the study was performed by a contract research organization, Covalent, under contract with the sponsor, and maintained the trial database. The IVUS end points were prepared by the Intravascular Ultrasound Core Laboratory at the Cleveland Clinic. Primary statistical analysis was performed by Pfizer. All tables, listings, and analyses were performed and created by the writing group. After completion of the trial, as specified in the study contract, a complete copy of the database was transferred to the Cleveland Clinic Cardiovascular Coordinating Center, in which primary efficacy analyses were verified by independent statisticians (Marlene Goormastic, MPH, Kathy Wolski, MPH, and Craig Balog, BS). The manuscript was prepared by the corresponding author and modified after consultation with coauthors. The sponsor was permitted to review the manuscript and suggest changes, but the final decision on content was exclusively retained by the authors.

JB, GB, JTW, RF, JCM, and DTB provided trial management and support. A-MG, FE, MM, and DTB contributed to randomisation, data processing, and statistical analysis. FM, J-PM, GM, LB, HFV, and HTL provided international oversight. JB, A-MG, MM, JCM, and DTB were the writing team. Conflicts of interest: The chief investigator received a fee as a speaker at a Bayer workshop in 2010. None of the co-authors have any financial relationship with either of the commercial sponsors. We declare that we have no conflicts of interest. Acknowledgments: The CAPP2 study is an academic collaboration. Funding was initially provided by a European Union award supplemented by Programme funding in Newcastle and Leeds from Cancer Research UK (C588/A10589). Following completion of design and choice of interventions, Bayer Corporation and National Starch and Chemical Co were approached for support. Both provided free intervention including the cost of packaging and made donations to Newcastle University to help cover the cost of administration and distribution. They had no influence on design, conduct, or analysis of the study. The contracts associated with their donations required that they be given sight of the results before submission with up to 90 days for evaluation. The UK Medical Research Council (MRC) approved the trial in 2002 and became the primary funder. MRC steering and data monitoring committees were established. Financial contributions were also made to local sites by the Newcastle Hospitals trustees, Cancer Council of Victoria Australia, THRIPP South Africa, The Finnish Cancer Foundation and SIAK Switzerland. When renewal requests were declined by MRC and Cancer Research UK, follow-up analysis 2009-11 was supported by a donation from Bayer Schering Pharma to Newcastle University. CAPP2 has been made possible by all the participants who agreed to be randomised and take daily treatments for up to 4 years. Special mention must also be given to Pascale Ives (Melbourne, Australia) and Su Werner (Dusseldorf, Germany) for their exceptional recruitment achievements and to Pam Chapman, the project manager in the early stages of the CAPP2 study. Other core staff were Paul Adamson, Olive Armstrong, Julie Coaker, Jonathan Coxhead, Joanne Gascoyne, John Gilroy, Louise Lynagh, Lynn Reed, and Rachel Toes. Recruitment depended on a large number of colleagues around the world.

{"question": "question: What organizations are involved in the study? context: This evaluation would not have been possible without the cooperation of a number of people and organisations. Patients and staff in the various field sites allowed us access to their work and experiences, gave freely of their time, and engaged with our desire to gain an honest, richly informed account of events. Adastra provided a large quantitative dataset and background information which allowed us to undertake an independent analysis. The evaluation benefited from the Summary Care Record Independent Evaluation (SCRIE) External Advisory Group, chaired by lay member Jenni Bowley, which served as a diverse, critical, and questioning audience for our emerging findings. Members (listed in full elsewhere14) included representatives from patient groups, academic institutions, professional organisations, and Connecting for Health. The study was part of the Connecting for Health Evaluation Programme coordinated by Richard Lilford\u2019s team at the University of Birmingham. Academic colleagues too numerous to list provided feedback and guidance throughout the study. Contributors: TG designed the study, led the development of the theoretical and methodological approach, helped with data collection, led the qualitative data analysis, drafted the paper, and is responsible for the integrity of the work.

Deborah Swinglehurst assisted with data collection and analysis. Enrico Coiera, Mike Pringle, and Ole Hanseth reviewed an earlier draft of the paper and added additional insights and references. Funding: The independent evaluation of the summary care record programme was funded by a research grant from the UK National Institute of Health Research (ref CFHEP002 and 007). The Medical Research Council funded a parallel research study (\u201chealthcare electronic records in organisations,\u201d ref 07/133) by our team in which the SCR formed one case example.
